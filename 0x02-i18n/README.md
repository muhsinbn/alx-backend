## Introduction:
This project focuses on implementing Internationalization (i18n) in a web application. Internationalization is the process of making an application adaptable to different languages and regions without engineering changes. With i18n, you ensure that your application can be easily localized for various locales, handling translations, formats, and other locale-specific information seamlessly.

The goal is to provide a web application that can support multiple languages, allowing users to switch between them dynamically.
